                Our approach is to utilize new technologies such as virtual reality, motion learning and real time tracking in order to create a new category of digital training & E-sports. We focus on motion learning, the real key of being able to play tennis well. In future, you will be able to learn, practice and play in virtual reality, as realistic and authentic as on the tennis court. There will be virtual tournaments and E-sport events & conventions bringing a whole new audience of folks and kids playing tennis.            </p>

            <p class="article-p">
                The player’s biomechanical data are scanned and processed while the system calculates the optimal pattern of movements. Then, the user puts on the VR goggles, takes the racket and starts playing tennis – on a virtual court, with virtual balls, instructed by a virtual coach and against virtual opponents.
                All body movements are accurately recorded and analyzed. Any deviations of the relevant parameters, like body position, legwork, arm position, stroke etc., are visualized on a “virtual dashboard” and via a real-time and replay “shadow”. At first, the player starts the training in slow motion, secondly progresses step by step in fast modus improving the strokes and body movements in order to learn perfect ones.
